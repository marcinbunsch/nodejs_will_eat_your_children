NODE.JS WILL EAT YOUR CHILDREN!
===================================

Nah, kidding. I just wanted to have some fun and see whether it would be possible to have nicely shared code between frontend and backend when the backend is based on node.js.

Obviously you can. No more Ruby in the middle required. Go JS!

So can we finally stop being afraid of javascript? ;)
